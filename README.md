NAME
====

Test::Script::Output - Tests the output of scripts using special comments

SYNOPSIS
========

    use Test::Script::Output;

    # in the tested file, file.p6
    say "Hello";

      Hello

    # in test
    output-ok( "file.p6", "script runs OK")

    # Another tested file, regex.p6
    say "Time now is ", now;

      /^^Time now/

    # in test
    output-ok( "regex.p6", "script tested via regex runs OK")

DESCRIPTION
===========

`Test::Script::Output` tests the output of scripts. Desired output must be included aas an `=output` pod section with the literal output that should be expected from it. If that changes, a regular expression can be used.

You can either set the output explicitly

        First line
        Second line

Or match the whole output via a regex, which can be used when the output is variable

        /^^ Start /

The scripts can include external compunits as long as they're available, and you take care of including all relevant paths via `use lib`.

If you want to check out how this works, the biggest collection of examples is at [https://github.com/JJ/perl6-quick-reference-apress](https://github.com/JJ/perl6-quick-reference-apress).

Provided is also a Dockerfile you can use directly for your tests; check it out at [https://cloud.docker.com/repository/docker/jjmerelo/perl6-test-script-output/](https://cloud.docker.com/repository/docker/jjmerelo/perl6-test-script-output/)

Use this `.travis.yml` for testing your scripts (or something like that, changing the name of the directory)

    language: minimal

    services:
      - docker

    install:
      - docker pull jjmerelo/perl6-test-script-output
      - mkdir t && echo "use Test::Script::Output;for <Chapter7 Chapter8 Chapter9 Chapter10> -> \$d { dir-ok( \$d.IO , 'Scripts in dir ' ~ \$d ~ ' are OK') }" > t/0.t

    script: docker run -t -v  $TRAVIS_BUILD_DIR:/test jjmerelo/perl6-test-script-output

Methods
=======

output-ok( $file, $msg)
-----------------------

The argument can be either the name of an existing file, or a IO handle for that same file; the `$msg` is the test message.

dir-ok( $dir, $msg)
-------------------

Takes the files with the extension "*.p6" from a dir, and tests them, the test will be OK if all of the files check out.

_get_output( $f )
-----------------

This is the routine doing the real work of extracting the expected and actual output from the file. It's not exported by default.

This test module was created originally to test the scripts for the book "Perl 6 Quick Reference", which is due to be published later this year by Apress.
