	* Dockerfile: This version is also able to install dependencies needed to test in the Dockerfile. This is not a code, but only a Dockerfile change.

	* lib/Test/Script/Output.pm6: Factors out the output-extraction routine.
	This is version 0.0.4, whose main improvement is to be able to test file-library combos, with "use lib" statements (which errored in the previous version).
